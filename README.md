# Predicting a Fraudulent Firm

## Data Set Information:
This dataset is taken from a research explained below.

The goal of the research is to help the auditors by building a regression/classification model that can predict the fraudulent firm on the basis the present and historical risk factors. The information about the sectors and the counts of firms are listed respectively as Irrigation (114), Public Health (77), Buildings and Roads (82), Forest (70), Corporate (47), Animal Husbandry (95), Communication (1), Electrical (4), Land (5), Science and Technology (3), Tourism (1), Fisheries (41), Industries (37), Agriculture (200).

#### There are two csv files to present data: audit_risk and trial. Both these files have been merged for the purpose of analysis.

#### Audit_Risk is considered as target column for regression tasks, and Risk as the target column for classification tasks. 

## Attribute Information:
Many risk factors are examined from various areas like past records of audit office, audit-paras, environmental conditions reports, firm reputation summary, on-going issues report, profit-value records, loss-value records, follow-up reports etc. After in-depth interview with the auditors, important risk factors are evaluated and their probability of existence is calculated from the present and past records.
